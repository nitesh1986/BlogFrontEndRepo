Design Decisions and Application Structure:

markdown

### Design Decisions

- **Frameworks:** Chose Angular for the frontend for its robust ecosystem and .NET Core for the backend for its performance and scalability.
- **State Management:** Utilized RxJS for state management in Angular, ensuring a reactive approach to data handling.
- **Styling:** Used Bootstrap for styling to create a responsive and consistent UI.
- **API Structure:** Designed RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on blog posts.

### Application Structure

- **Frontend:**
  - `src/app/components`: Contains Angular components such as `BlogListComponent` and `BlogFormComponent`.
  - `src/app/services`: Contains services for handling HTTP requests, e.g., `BlogService`.
  - `src/app/models`: Contains data models, e.g., `BlogPost`.
